Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n * constructor() {\n *     _disableInitializers();\n * }\n * ```\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Storage of the initializable contract.\n     *\n     * It's implemented on a custom ERC-7201 namespace to reduce the risk of storage collisions\n     * when using with upgradeable contracts.\n     *\n     * @custom:storage-location erc7201:openzeppelin.storage.Initializable\n     */\n    struct InitializableStorage {\n        /**\n         * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n         */\n        uint64 _initialized;\n        /**\n         * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n         */\n        bool _initializing;\n    }\n\n    // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256(\"openzeppelin.storage.Initializable\")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))\n    bytes32 private constant INITIALIZABLE_STORAGE = 0xf0c57e16840df040f15088dc2f81fe391c3923bec73e23a9662efc9c229c6a00;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev The contract is already initialized.\n     */\n    error InvalidInitialization();\n\n    /**\n     * @dev The contract is not initializing.\n     */\n    error NotInitializing();\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\n     */\n    event Initialized(uint64 version);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"errors\":{\"InvalidInitialization()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is already initialized.\"}],\"NotInitializing()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is not initializing.\"}]},\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\".deps/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\".deps/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x631188737069917d2f909d29ce62c4d48611d326686ba6683e26b72a23bfac0b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7a61054ae84cd6c4d04c0c4450ba1d6de41e27e0a2c4f1bcdf58f796b401c609\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmUvtdp7X1mRVyC3CsHrtPbgoqWaXHp3S1ZR24tpAQYJWM\"]}},\"version\":1}",

								"text": " @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n ===="

This means\n that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n to implement supply mechanisms].\n The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n applications.\n Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n these events, as it isn't required by the specification."
