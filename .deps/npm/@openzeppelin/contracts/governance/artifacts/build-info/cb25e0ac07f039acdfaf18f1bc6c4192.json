There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`. - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`. - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum. - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum. If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example: - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain. - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

The string is a URL-encoded sequence of\n key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.\n There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.\n - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`.\n - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.\n - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.\n If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique\n name that describes the behavior. For example:\n - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain.\n - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.\n NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard\n https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams[`URLSearchParams`]\n JavaScript class."
