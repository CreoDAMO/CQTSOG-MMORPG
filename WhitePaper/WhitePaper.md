## Tokenomics

### CQT (CryptoQuest Token)
The CryptoQuest ecosystem is powered by the CQT (CryptoQuest Token), an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. The CQT token serves as the primary currency for in-game transactions, player-to-player trades, and interactions with the broader CryptoQuest ecosystem.

### Token Distribution
- **Total Supply:** 1 billion CQT tokens
- **Initial Coin Offering (ICO):** 30% of total supply
- **Community Rewards:** 20% of total supply
- **Team and Advisors:** 15% of total supply
- **Ecosystem Development:** 15% of total supply
- **Marketing and Partnerships:** 10% of total supply
- **Treasury:** 10% of total supply

### Token Utility

- **Player-to-Player Trades:** Players can use CQT tokens to trade NFT-based assets on the CryptoQuest marketplace.
- **Governance:** CQT token holders will have a say in the decision-making process for the game's development and ecosystem.
- **Staking and Rewards:** Players can stake their CQT tokens to earn additional rewards and participate in the game's governance.
- **Cross-Chain Interactions:** CQT tokens can be used for interactions with other blockchain-based games and platforms, fostering a broader ecosystem.

### Token Release Schedule

### Initial Price Recommendation for CQT Token on Uniswap

Based on the detailed analysis of key factors, the recommended initial price for the CQT (CryptoQuest Token) on Uniswap V4 is **$0.30** per token. 

### Justification for the Price:

1. **Total Supply and Distribution**:
   - With a total supply of **1 billion CQT tokens** and **300 million available during the ICO**, starting at $0.30 allows for a balanced entry point that is accessible to early investors while reflecting the potential for future growth.

2. **Market Analysis**:
   - Targeting gamers aged **18-35** and blockchain enthusiasts, this price point positions CQT competitively within the market. Notably, Axie Infinity’s initial price at **$0.10** sets a precedent, but CQT's unique features and utility justify a higher entry point.

3. **Token Utility**:
   - The diverse functionalities of CQT tokens—ranging from in-game transactions to governance and staking—enhance the token's value proposition, supporting the rationale for the $0.30 price.

4. **Revenue Projections**:
   - The projected revenue growth from **$1 million in Year 1** to **$10 million by Year 3** indicates strong financial performance, supporting a valuation that reflects future earnings potential.

5. **Community Feedback**:
   - Feedback suggesting an initial price range of **$0.30 to $0.50** aligns with the proposed $0.30 price, ensuring accessibility for investors while allowing room for appreciation as the game and ecosystem develop.

### Liquidity and Initial Setup:

- **Initial Liquidity**: It’s crucial to ensure adequate liquidity to facilitate smooth trading on Uniswap. 
- **Pairing**: Pairing CQT with **ETH or a stablecoin like USDT** is advisable to enhance trading stability.

### Calculation Example:

- **Initial Liquidity Setup**:
   - Assuming we provide **100 ETH** and **1,000,000 CQT** tokens as initial liquidity:
   - If **1 ETH = $2,000**, then **100 ETH = $200,000** total value.
   - **Initial CQT Price in ETH**: \( \frac{100 \text{ ETH}}{1,000,000 \text{ CQT}} = 0.0001 \text{ ETH per CQT} \).
   - **Initial CQT Price in USD**: \( 0.0001 \text{ ETH} \times 2000 = 0.30 \text{ USD per CQT} \).

### Final Considerations:

- **Monitoring**: Post-launch, it’s essential to monitor market conditions and community sentiment. Be ready to adjust liquidity and potentially the price as the project gains traction and user engagement grows.
  
This approach balances early adoption incentives with the potential for future growth, setting a solid foundation for the CryptoQuest ecosystem.
