# Revolutionizing Gaming with Blockchain: The Making of CryptoQuest: The Shards of Genesis

**CryptoQuest: The Shards of Genesis** is setting a new standard in the world of MMORPGs by integrating blockchain technology to offer players true ownership of their in-game assets. Developed using both Unity and Unreal Engine 5, this ambitious project merges the immersive gameplay of traditional gaming with the innovative possibilities of blockchain.

## **Introduction**

In the evolving landscape of digital entertainment, *CryptoQuest: The Shards of Genesis* stands out as a groundbreaking project that leverages blockchain to redefine player engagement and ownership. Imagine a game where every item, character, and piece of land is a unique non-fungible token (NFT), giving players the power to truly own, trade, and impact the game world. This vision is becoming a reality through the development of *CryptoQuest*.

## **Features**

### **True Ownership**
At the core of *CryptoQuest* is the concept of true ownership. Every in-game asset is an NFT, which means players have full control over their items. These assets can be traded or sold, providing a real-world value to in-game achievements.

### **Decentralized Economy**
The game's economy is decentralized, with an in-game marketplace that facilitates trading. A dedicated cryptocurrency token is used as the primary currency, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.

### **Player Governance**
Zones within the game are governed by councils elected by players. This feature empowers the community to influence game rules, events, and development, fostering a deeper connection and investment in the game.

### **Crafting & Enchanting**
Blockchain technology ensures the uniqueness of crafted items and enchantments, adding significant value to player creations and enhancing the gameplay experience.

### **Quests & Adventures**
A dynamic quest system allows players to create and share their own quests. Smart contracts ensure that rewards are distributed fairly and transparently.

### **Cross-Chain Interactions**
Supporting multiple blockchains, *CryptoQuest* facilitates a broader ecosystem and enables cross-chain asset transfers, enhancing the game's flexibility and reach.

## **Game Overview**

Set in the mythical realm of Cryptonia, *CryptoQuest: The Shards of Genesis* invites players to embark on an epic journey to uncover the secrets of the Genesians and the Shards of Genesis. Players navigate political intrigue, battle fierce creatures, and explore uncharted territories in their quest to reunify the shards and restore balance to the realm.

## **Blockchain Integration**

### **Smart Contracts and NFTs**

Smart contracts are the backbone of *CryptoQuest*. These contracts manage the creation, ownership, and trading of NFTs within the game. Each in-game item, from weapons to land parcels, is represented as an NFT, providing unique attributes and ensuring secure ownership.

### **Decentralized Marketplace**

The decentralized marketplace is where the magic happens. Players can list items for sale, place bids, and complete transactions seamlessly. The marketplace is powered by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness in every trade.

### **Player Governance**

Governance in *CryptoQuest* is driven by the community. Players can submit proposals, vote on changes, and influence the direction of the game. This democratic approach fosters a strong community and ensures that the game evolves in line with player preferences.

## **Developing CryptoQuest: React.js vs. Unity vs. Unreal Engine 5**

### **React.js**

React.js is used to develop a front-end DApp that interacts with all 21 smart contracts. Here’s how to set up your DApp using React:

#### **Contract Configurations**

**index.js**:

```javascript
import CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG from './CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG.json';
import CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken from './CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken.json';
import CryptoQuestSwap from './CryptoQuestSwap.json';

export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ABI = CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG.abi;
export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ABI = CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken.abi;
export const CryptoQuestSwap_ABI = CryptoQuestSwap.abi;

export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ADDRESS = "your_contract_address_here";
export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ADDRESS = "your_contract_address_here";
export const CryptoQuestSwap_ADDRESS = "your_contract_address_here";
```

#### **Setting Up Web3Modal for Wallet Connection**

Create a new file `src/utils/web3Modal.js`:

```javascript
import Web3Modal from "web3modal";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { InjectedConnector } from "@web3-react/injected-connector";
import { Web3Provider } from "@ethersproject/providers";

export const injected = new InjectedConnector({
    supportedChainIds: [1, 3, 4, 5, 42]
});

export const web3Modal = new Web3Modal({
    cacheProvider: true,
    providerOptions: {}
});

export const getLibrary = (provider) => {
    const library = new Web3Provider(provider);
    library.pollingInterval = 12000;
    return library;
};
```

#### **Create Context for Web3**

Set up a `Web3Context` to manage web3 state across your app:

**Web3Context.js**:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { web3Modal, getLibrary } from '../utils/web3Modal';

export const Web3Context = createContext();

export const Web3Provider = ({ children }) => {
    const [provider, setProvider] = useState(null);
    const [library, setLibrary] = useState(null);
    const [account, setAccount] = useState(null);
    const [chainId, setChainId] = useState(null);

    const connect = async () => {
        const instance = await web3Modal.connect();
        const library = getLibrary(instance);
        const accounts = await library.listAccounts();
        const network = await library.getNetwork();

        setProvider(instance);
        setLibrary(library);
        if (accounts) setAccount(accounts[0]);
        setChainId(network.chainId);
    };

    const disconnect = async () => {
        web3Modal.clearCachedProvider();
        setProvider(null);
        setLibrary(null);
        setAccount(null);
        setChainId(null);
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        if (web3Modal.cachedProvider) {
            connect();
        }
    }, []);

    return (
        <Web3Context.Provider value={{ connect, disconnect, provider, library, account, chainId }}>
            {children}
        </Web3Context.Provider>
    );
};
```

#### **Interacting with Smart Contracts**

**contracts.js**:

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import {
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ABI,
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ABI,
    CryptoQuestSwap_ABI,
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ADDRESS,
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ADDRESS,
    CryptoQuestSwap_ADDRESS,
} from '../contracts';

export const getContract = (abi, address, library) => {
    const signer = library.getSigner();
    return new ethers.Contract(address, abi, signer);
};

export const getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPGContract = (library) => {
    return getContract(CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ABI, CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ADDRESS, library);
};

export const getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisTokenContract = (library) => {
    return getContract(CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ABI, CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ADDRESS, library);
};

export const getCryptoQuestSwapContract = (library) => {
    return getContract(CryptoQuestSwap_ABI, CryptoQuestSwap_ADDRESS, library);
};
```
